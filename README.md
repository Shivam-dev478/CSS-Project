# CSS-Project
My first two project based on Hover effects.Tools I used is HTML and CSS 
Data-hover Effect in which hover mouse on text and changes to another text
Cool unique hover effect
19/09/2024-Css animation tricks used for different timing function for different states by using transition:transform 1000ms; and in :hover selector we use transform:translateY(-0.75rem); and transition:transform 250ms;
@keyframes for changing background-color and we discover order of keyframes animation dosen't matter.
